# instant-runoff

This this notebook calculates the winners for an instant runoff election with multiple possible winners (standard 5) from a txt file with copy pasted discord logs.

instead of  running instant runoff once and stopping when the amount of candidates left equals the empty seats, this algorithm simply runs  instant ronoff multiple times.

there's also a more standard single transferable vote notebook, which uses fractional votes, but ignores winners when they're arrived at later in the process.
